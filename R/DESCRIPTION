Description: This package improves upon the existing LifeTable Function from the MortalityLaws package. What it does is generate both a life table and a survivorship curve, given only  few vectors. The input parameters are x, which is time (most oven measured by peoples' ages, but can also be a vector of continuous years), Dx, which is the total number of incidences (deaths) occurring in that time interval, and Dx, the mortality rate for that time interval.
